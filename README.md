# css-test

For this following test,

I used SASS (scss) witch is a modular approach and worked with Git.

I created a responsive HTML page with the following elements:


A top sticky Menu with 4 links (who doesn't lead anywhere), in 1920-1080 resolution and displayed as a single button from 375-667 resolution.

The menu elements are taking up the whole width of the menu, with full text displayed for each menu item when the resolution is higher than 375*667.

9 Identical elements on the page, each using the image (bugs-bunny.png) as a background, displayed as a circle.

Each object is 200px high * 200px wide and has an animated effect when hovered.

These elements are displayed as a 3x3 grid at 1080-1920 resolution and scale down to a 1x9 grid at 320-480 resolution. The grid is 3x3 max.
