This is my CSS test

I Used SASS (scss), used modular approach and worked with Git. 

I created a responsive HTML page with the following elements on it:


A top menu with 4 links, they don't have to lead anywhere.
Top sticky menu in 1920-1080 resolution and display as a single button from 375-667 resolution.

The menu elements should take up the whole width of the menu,
display the full text for each menu item when resolution is higher than 375*667. 

9 identical elements on the page, each using the image (bugs-bunny.png) as a background, displaying it as a circle. 

Each objects are 200px and have an animated effect when hovered. 
These elements should be displayed as a 3x3 grid at 1080-1920 resolution and scale down to 1x9 grid at 320-480 resolution.
The grid must not be bigger than 3x3.
